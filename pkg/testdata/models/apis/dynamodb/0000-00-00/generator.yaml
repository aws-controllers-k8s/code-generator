  DescribeBackup:
    # DescribeBackupOutput is an unusual shape because it contains information for
    # the backup it self (BackupDetails), the table details when the backup was
    # created (SourceTableDetails) and the table features (SourceTableFeatureDetails).
    # If not specified the code generator will try to determine the wrapper field by
    # selecting for the output shape that only have a single member, which is incorrect
    # in this case.
